I"µ<p>I am a final year masterâ€™s student at the University of Konstanz. 
My general areas of interest are machine learning and computer vision. 
More specifically, I am highly interested in Geometric Deep Learning and Neural Scene Representations.<br />
Currently I am working on my masterâ€™s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Bastian GoldlÃ¼cke, 
where I am exploring how a geometrically inspired neural network design 
can benefit neural implicit shape representations for 3D reconstruction. <br />
In my future research I hope to take steps towards algorithms, that like humans, 
easily perceive, understand and abstractly reason about their 3D environments from few observations.</p>
