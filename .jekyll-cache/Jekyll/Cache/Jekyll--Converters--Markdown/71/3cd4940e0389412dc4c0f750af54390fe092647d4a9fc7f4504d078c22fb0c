I"q<p>I am a final year master’s student at the University of Konstanz. My general areas of interest are machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, I am highly interested in Geometric Deep Learning and Neural Scene Representations. Currently I am working on my master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Bastian Goldlücke, where I am exploring how a geometrically inspired neural network design can benefit neural implicit shape representations for 3D reconstruction. In the future I hope to help  &lt;&gt; perceive, understand and abstractly reason about their 3D environments from few observations</p>
