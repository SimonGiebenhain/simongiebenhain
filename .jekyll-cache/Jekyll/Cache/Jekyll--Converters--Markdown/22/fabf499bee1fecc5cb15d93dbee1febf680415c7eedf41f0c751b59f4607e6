I"š<p>I am a final year masterâ€™s student at the University of Konstanz. My general areas of interest are machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, I am highly interested in Geometric Deep Learning and Neural Scene Representations. Currently I am working on my masterâ€™s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Bastian GoldlÃ¼cke, where I am exploring how a geometrically inspired neural network design can benefit neural implicit shape representations for 3D reconstruction. I hope that my future research contributes towards robots, like humans, perceiving, understanding and abstractly reasoning about their 3D environments from few observations</p>
