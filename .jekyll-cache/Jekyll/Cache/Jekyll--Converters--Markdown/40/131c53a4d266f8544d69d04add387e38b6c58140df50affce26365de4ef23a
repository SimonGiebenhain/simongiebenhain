I"y<p>I am a final year master’s student at the University of Konstanz. I am highly interested in machine learning and computer vision. Currently I am working on my master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Bastian Goldlücke. There I am exploring how a geometrically inspired neural network design can benefit neural implicit representations for 3D reconstruction.</p>
