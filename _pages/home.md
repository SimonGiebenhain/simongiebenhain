I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich at the <a href="https://niessnerlab.org">Niessnerlab</a>.
My general areas of interest are machine learning, computer vision and graphics. 
More specifically, I am highly interested in virtual avatars, generative models and 3D scene representations.
I search for a good blanace between domain specific inductive biases and efficient neural network design.
Previously I recieved my master's degree at the University of Konstanz under the supervision of Prof. Bastian Goldl√ºcke.
