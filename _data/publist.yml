  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
