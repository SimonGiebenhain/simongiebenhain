- title: "AIR-Nets: An Attention-Based Framework for Locally Conditioned Implicit Representations"
  image: anim.gif
  description: AIR-Net is the first encoder-based, grid-free, implcit shape representation model.
                Our network design focuses on conformity with geometric properties like 
                permutation invariance and translation equivariance of the point cloud. 
                Furthermore, our network operates on the k-nearest-neighbor graph, which encodes an effective anf efficient inductive bias.
                Using an expressive decoder, we are able to condition an implicit function on a sparse set of local latent vectors.
                While this simple latent representation certainly offers exciting avenues for future work, our model is still significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art.

- title: "Radar Ghost Target Detection via Multimodal Transformers"

  description: The safety of autonmous vehicles is heavily dependent on the reliability of its underlying sensor measurements.
                While radar is often overlooked, its all-day, all-weather and long-range capabilities, as well as, low price render it a promising candidate.
                In this paper we introduce an attention based sensor-fusion method, to filter out false-positive detections (so called ghost targets) in radar.
